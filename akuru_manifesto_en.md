# The Akuru Manifesto

The words etched on the surface hold the power to make or break this world: ‘Akuru’ sees this power and looks to understand it better so that we may share it, use it and surmount it.
Akuru is a collective of people coming together to inspire interest in typography.

As incredibly powerful representations of languages and therefore cultures, all forms of typographic communications call for an elevated understanding and appreciation: Akuru stands for recognising this power and using it thoughtfully, responsibly and intelligently. Akuru is also an extension of the collective and individual responsibility felt by all its members for their ability to influence human communication, and their wish to use that power to partake in creating better tomorrows.

Akuru has a special interest in all languages of Sri Lanka and the region, particularly Sinhala, Tamil and Thaana typography, and looks to enrich their transition into the digital realm where new kinds of publications, readers and writers have taken the lead.

With this in mind, Akuru looks to openly share typographic culture, knowledge and resources as well as experiences and opinions, with colleagues, students and others who may be interested. The collective also influences the maintenance and promotion of typographic standards by collaborating with education institutes and businesses.

Akuru believes that possibilities for innovation in typography are far from being exhausted, and that rethinking its functions, psychological implications and aesthetics will bear serious impact on our civilisation෴
